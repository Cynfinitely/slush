Slush is a full-stack web application created using the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React, and Node.js) and Tailwind CSS. The application is designed to help users manage their tasks by providing a simple and intuitive interface for creating, editing, and deleting tasks. It also includes authentication and authorization functionality to ensure that only authorized users can access certain features. There is also matching system beyond users about their roles.

## Features

The application includes the following features:

- User registration and login
- Task creation and deletion
- Task updating
- User profile editing
- Password resetting
- Authentication and authorization
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- User Matching System

## Technologies Used

The following technologies were used to create this project:

- PostgreSQL
- Express.js
- React
- Node.js
- Tailwind CSS

## Project Structure

The project follows a typical PERN stack directory structure, with the server code in the `server` directory and the client code in the `client` directory. The server code uses the `express` framework and the `pg` library for interacting with the PostgreSQL database. The client code uses the `react` library and the `axios` library for making HTTP requests to the server.

## Conclusion

This project showcases my skills in full-stack web development using the PERN stack and Tailwind CSS. The task management application includes all the basic features required for a typical CRUD application, as well as authentication and authorization functionality. I hope this project will help me demonstrate my abilities as a junior full-stack developer to potential employers.
